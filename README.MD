# The Paleo Matrix 
## A program that decides what meals you eat

### to be transparent, it's just a little goofy go application that randomizes things from several lists and gives you a recipe you can cook up and eat.
- It's nothing special! This was more for me to get some chops in Go programming
- It's not perfect! There are several ways to refactor this and make it better
- This stems from "The paleo matrix" by Robb Wolf. Go check him out at https://robbwolf.com/
- DISCLAIMER: this little app is not endorsed or used in any way by Robb Wolf or anyone associated to him. 

### How to modify
 - There are several text files in the config folder: meats, oils, spices, and veggies( as .txt files). you can add/remove items from each list to fit your needs
 - Once this is done, rerun/rebuild the main.go file and it will produce a random list of stuff you can cook. 
 - The main.go file is pretty simple, feel free to change the output as you see fit

### How to contribute
 - I am not accepting pull requests for this right now. This was more for me to learn Go Programming. I will continue development on it as i am able.
 - Please feel free to fork the repo and improve/distribute as you see fit, and if you do, drop me a line at dacgithub@gmail.com telling me all about it!
