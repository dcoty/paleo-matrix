# The Paleo Matrix 
## A program that decides what meals you eat

### To be transparent, this is just a little goofy Golang application that randomizes things from several lists and gives you a recipe you can cook up and eat.
- It's nothing special! This was more for me to get some chops in Go programming
- It's not perfect! There are several ways to refactor this and make it better
- This program is inspired by the paleo food matrix: https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/thePaleoSolution_FoodMatrix.pdf
- DISCLAIMER: This app is not endorsed or used in any way by Robb Wolf or anyone associated to him. All credit to Robb Wolf for the food matrix and the PDF above. I just stood on the shoulders of giants here.

### How to modify
 - There are several text files in the config folder: meats, oils, spices, and veggies( as .txt files). you can add/remove items from each list to fit your needs
 - Once this is done, rerun/rebuild the main.go file and it will produce a random list of stuff you can cook. 
 - The main.go file is pretty simple, feel free to change the output as you see fit

### How to contribute
 - I am not accepting pull requests for this right now. This was more for me to learn Go Programming. I will continue development on it as i am able.
 - Please feel free to fork the repo and improve/distribute as you see fit, and if you do, drop me a line at dacgithub@gmail.com telling me all about it!
